# Notes

## TDD

1. A reminder of always split your problem in the smallest possible features in a way that you continually have
**working** software. This is a muscle that needs training.
2. When we deal with IO that take some time to process, mocking (or faking) comes a long way!

Takeaways

1. We can use dependency injection to insert mocks to our functions.
2. Design fakes in a way that we can spy if they were called and used i.e. behaviored as expected.
