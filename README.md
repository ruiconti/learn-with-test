# Learn Go through TDD 

Reference: https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/

It's a straightforward and fun introduction to the language. Teaching using a TDD approach is a major feature, as it's a more productive way of thinking and coding.

### Projects

This is a nice entrypoint to Golang. But it must be followed with some more practice and further studying.

- Simple overview documentation: Deepen on major features while comparing to Python, analogous to Go by example but for Pythonistas.
- Simple tested webapp (from this course, while refering to [this](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-go-web-applications-and-microservices-using-gin))
- A raw HTTP server, refering to [this](https://github.com/rby90/project-based-tutorials-in-c#computer-networking), [this](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html//index.html#slightly-advanced-techniques) and [this](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/concurrent-servers-part-1-introduction/)
